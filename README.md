# ProceduralTerrainGenerator
This is a sample of a random terrain generation algorithm that I created for use in game creation.

It is currently inside a Monogame project to demonstrate in 2D what it looks like

I plan on using this inside Unity to tune it more & to see exactly how it influences the terrain (currently Unity isn't working on my computer, so I couldn't use it to demonstrate the algorithm)
